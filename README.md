# Generating-Eminem-Lyrics-using-an-LSTM-Network

This python script mainly deals  with generating Eminem lyrics, which is achieved using an LSTM (Long Short
Term Memory) network, a fairly simple extension of neural networks brought out to overcome the drawbacks of the recurrent
neural networks.
Lyrics of several songs of eminem were collected and stored in the file : eminem.txt, that was used for training our model.
The model does not use any special libraries, and has been bult from scratch using Numpy.
